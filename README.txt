Purpose of Program: This program was written per an assignment for Embedded 
Microcomputer Systems (ECE 4437) at the University of Houston. 

The design of this project is intended to create a robot operated by a 
microcontroller that is able to navigate independently through a maze via equipped 
sensors. The Robot may be controlled via Bluetooth that enable commands. 

A run-through of the maze demo will be uploaded when we reach the Milestone. 
For now, this gitHub will be continuously updated.
